            <p>HLTV is a website dedicated to the coverage of competitive Counter-Strike. It features news, schedules, results, livescores, statistics, photographs, and a dedicated community forum. The website is also known for its Rating, MVP award, team world ranking, yearly Top 20 players ranking, and Award Show.</p>

            <h2>History</h2>
            <p>HLTV was founded in 2002 by Martin "Martin" Rosenbæk and Per "Nomad" Lambæk. It was initially created to host "Half-Life TV" IP addresses and demos, which were used to watch Counter-Strike matches in the early days of the game. Since then, the website evolved to include news, results, statistics, and more.</p>
            <p>In 2012, HLTV transitioned from covering Counter-Strike 1.6 to Counter-Strike: Global Offensive, and moved on to Counter-Strike 2 in 2023.</p>
            <p>The Top 20 players of the year ranking was first released in 2010, and has been done every year since, except in 2012 which was a transition year between two versions of the game.</p>
            <p>In 2015, HLTV unveiled its team world ranking, which is updated once per week and is regularly used by tournament organizers to decide invites and seeding. HLTV began to award HLTV MVP medals to the best performing players at top-tier tournaments in CS:GO, and continues to do so in CS2.</p>
            <p>In 2020, HLTV and its regional sister site Dust2.dk were acquired by Better Collective, a digital sports media group based in Denmark.</p>
